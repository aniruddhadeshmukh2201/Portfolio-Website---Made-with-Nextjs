  //   title: "Tank Battle Game - Canvas Project",
  //   description:
  //     "This project is a 2D tank battle game developed using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, inspired by classic arcade tank games. Players control a tank, maneuvering through a battlefield while shooting at enemies. The game features real-time physics, bullet trajectories, and enemy AI. I used Canvas API to create smooth animations, collision detection, and player interactions. This project was instrumental in deepening my understanding of game logic, state management, and rendering graphics efficiently on a 2D canvas.",
